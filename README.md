## Creation Process

The majority of these shiny icons were created using our custom [Sprite Recolor Tool](https://github.com/BlupBlurp/sprite-recolor-tool). This tool takes:

- An original sprite/icon
- A normal Pokémon texture reference
- A shiny Pokémon texture reference

The tool then recolors the sprite to match the shiny color palette.

## Usage

These icons are **free to use** for personal and community projects.
